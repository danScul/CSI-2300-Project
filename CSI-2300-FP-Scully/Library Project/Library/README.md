This program is intended to be a resource to help catalogue and maintain a large collection of books, such as for a library.

How to use:
Upon launch a window will open. In the top left will be where you can view your catalogue of books.


Below it is a series of four buttons: Add, Remove, Check Out, and Check In.

Add- Upon selecting Add a window will open and prompt you to fill out information to create a new catalogue entry. You will be asked to enter a title, the author's name, and whether the book is fiction or nonfiction. Once you select either fiction or non-fiction, an additional prompt is added for the genre or the dewey decimal number respectively. (If you are not familiar with the Dewey Decimal System, clicking on 'Dewey Decimal System' will open a link to a Wikipedia entry that details it).

Remove- By clicking on an entry in the catalogue then clicking the remove button will delete the book from the catalogue entirely.

Check Out- By clicking on an entry in the catalogue then clicking the check out button, you will be prompted to create a user profile The book will be unavailable to check out again until it is checked in and will be added to your user profile. If you enter an account number already in use, it will be added to the existing account.

Check In- By clicking on an entry in the catalogue then clicking the check in button, the book will be made available once again and removed from the holder's account.


In the top right is a drop down menu with options on how to organize your catalogue. You can order them alphabetically, descending alphabetically, alphabetically by author's last name, and reverse alphabetically by author's name.


In the bottom right will be a display that provides information on the currently selected book.
