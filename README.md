Project Title: Library Inventory System 
Team Name: DS 
Team Members: Daniel Scully 

Description: This project will be an application to aid in the management and organization of a library’s inventory.
I would like to build it because I have worked in a library for upwards of seven years.
I have found that the tool that allows a library to run at peak efficiency is a well-managed inventory.
This application will allow a user to add and remove items from their collection, sort their collection in a variety of ways (by title [ascending & descending alphabetical], 
author’s last name, and Dewey Decimal System [allowing user to manually input with a key provided for reference]), search titles for keywords, check books in and out.
The user will be prompted to add a book to their collection (providing places to input the book’s title, author,
and whether it is fiction or nonfiction [if nonfiction also prompts for dds]).
The user's collection will be displayed below with the title, author’s last name and first initial visible. 
Once an item is in the collection it can be checked out or removed from the collection entirely.
When an item is checked out, it will be marked as such and unable to be checked out until returned but not removed from the collection entirely. 

Estimate of Effort: The bulk of the effort involved in the creation of this application would be the collection system as well as the implementation of the GUI.
The program requires the use of an array of 'Book' objects. Properly maintaining this array and keeping the user data associated will require testing to ensure it is all handled properly.
The implentation of the GUI may take some more signifcant time as well due to the multiple ways of sorting and displaying the information.
